# Building a Solar Server üåû

Running notes on how to build a solar server from the perspective of someone that's never built a server or anything solar powered.

## 1. Get Solar Power üîå

This seems fairly straight forward but will have unforseen issues I'm sure if I ever actually give it a shot.

* get a solar panel with a charge controller
* the charge controller regulates the output power
* hook this up (directly?) to a car battery
* get a power inverter to convert dc to ac power
* hook this up (directly?) to the car battery
* you now have normal ac power

## 2. Make a Simple Website üìÑ

In a nutshell, making your website small saves power. To make a small website no react, no javascript, dither your images, default serif font, no google analytics, no cookies, no ads.

  Hardware Observations
</strong></summary><br>
  
* a charge controller directly hooked up to a server via usb
* battery maybe optional

  Why a Low-tech Website?
</strong></summary><br>

* lowtech design meant to radically reduce server energy use
* internet meant to [dematerialise society and decrease energy use](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2012/energy-environment-technology-industries-smarter-2020-role-ict-driving-sustainable-future.aspx)
* internet is a [large / growing consumer of energy](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/can-the-internet-run-on-renewable-energy.html)
* the internet uses three times more energy than all current wind and solar power (source?)
* almost all pv solar panels are produced in china
* chinese energy grid is twice as carbonized and half as effecient as europe's
* web content is becoming increasingly resource intensive
* video and website size is to blame
* average web page was .45 MB in 2010 and 1.7-2.9 MB in 2018
* average mobile 'page weight' was .15 MB in 2011 to 1.6 MB in 2018
* [growth in web traffic surpasses increases in energy efficiency](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224224694/download)
* heavier / larger sites also shorten hardware lifetimes
* manufacturing computers is [extremely energy-intensive](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html)
* mobile devices create the need for an 'always-on' internet
* always-on internet access accompanies a cloud computing model
* cloud computing model decreases user device energy consumption but increases data center and network energy use
* once offline activities like file access now often require network access

  Lowtech Web Design
</strong></summary><br>
  
* the internet is not an autonomous being
* rising power consumption comes from choices web developers make
* converting a basic blog to a lowtech design decreases average page size by a factor of five
* average page weight is .77 MB
* less than half the page weight of the average site in 2018
* number of requests has also been decreased fivefold
* dowload speed has increased tenfold
* site is designed for low energy use not speed

<summary><strong>
  Static Site
</strong></summary><br>
  
* building a static site was a fundamental move
* most websites build pages on the fly after querying a database
* every request (repeats included) is generated on demand
* static sites generate pages once
* then static files live on the server's hard disk
* static sites are based on file storage
* dynamic sites depend on recurrent computation
* static sites require less processing power and less energy (how much? unclear)
*
