# Building a Solar Server

Running notes on how to build a solar server from the perspective of someone that's never built a server or anything solar powered.

## Solar Power

This seems fairly straight forward but will have unforseen issues I'm sure if I ever actually give it a shot. But as of now the steps seem to be...
* get a solar panel with a charge controller
* the charge controller regulates the output power
* hook this up (directly?) to a car battery
* get a power inverter to convert dc to ac power
* hook this up (directly?) to the car battery
* you now have normal ac power
